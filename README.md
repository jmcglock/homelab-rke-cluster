# My Homelab RKE Cluster

I decided to finally document how I set up my RKE cluster on my home server.
I know I can automate things, but I just have not had the time.

Expect this repo to change as I start automating processes.

## Notice that each directory is numbered:
This is because I have to do things in a certain order.
1. metallb
2. traefik
3. cert-manager
4. argocd

Enjoy!
